# AI-Powered App Generator

This Python script utilizes the Groq API to generate a complete application based on a given prompt. It employs a multi-agent approach to break down the app creation process into several steps.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Groq API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install groq
```

3. Set up your Groq API key as an environment variable or replace the placeholder in the script.

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python app_generator.py
```

The script will generate a Python application based on the initial prompt defined in the `main()` function.

## Features

This script includes several agent functions that work together to create an application:

1. `agent_idea_generator`: Generates the initial idea or concept for the app.
2. `agent_requirement_gatherer`: Collects and refines the requirements based on the idea.
3. `agent_design_architect`: Creates a high-level design or outline of the application.
4. `agent_code_writer`: Writes the actual code based on the design outline and saves it to `app.py`.

## Configuration

- The initial prompt can be modified in the `main()` function.
- The Groq API model used is "llama-3.2-3b-preview". This can be changed in each agent function if needed.

## License

This project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Security Note

Please ensure that you keep your Groq API key confidential and do not share it publicly. It's recommended to use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information.
